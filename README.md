# Homebrew-PHP

A centralized repository for PHP-related brews.

## Background

This repository contains **PHP-related** formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew).

(This replaces the php formulae that used to live under [adamv's homebrew-alt repository](https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt).)

The purpose of this repository is to allow PHP developers to quickly retrieve
working, up-to-date formulae. The mainline homebrew repositories are maintianed
by non-php developers, so testing/maintaining PHP-related brews has fallen by
the wayside. If you are a PHP developer using homebrew, please contribute to
this repository.

## Requirements

* Homebrew
* Snow Leopard or Lion - Untested against Mountain Lion

## Installation

_[Manual]_

* Download this: `http://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php/zipball/master`
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `/usr/local`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `LibraryPHP`

_[GIT Clone]_

In your `/usr/local` directory type

    git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php.git LibraryPHP

## Usage

### Quick Start

To install homebrew-php formulae, use one of the following:

 * `brew install [raw GitHub URL]`
 * `brew install [full path to formula from your local homebrew-php clone]`

For more details, see below: "Installing homebrew-php Formulae".

### Installing homebrew-php Formulae

There are two methods to install packages from this repository.

#### Method 1: Raw URL

First, find the raw URL for the formula you want. For example, the raw URL for
the `php` formula is:

    https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php/raw/master/php54/php53.rb

Once you know the raw URL, simply use `brew install [raw URL]`, like so:

    brew install https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php/raw/master/php54/php53.rb

#### Method 2: Repository Clone

First, clone this repository.  Be sure to choose a good location!

For example, clone to `LibraryPHP` under `/usr/local`:

    git clone https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php.git /usr/local/LibraryPHP

Once you've got your clone, simply use `brew install [full path to formula]`.

For example, to install `php`:

    brew install /usr/local/LibraryPHP/php54/php53.rb

That's it!

## Contributing

Any php-related tools should be in the `Formula` directory. PHP extensions and modifications
to the PHP brew itself should go in the respective `php*` directory. Pull requests containing
changes for all supported PHP versions would be delightful where possible.

All extensions should have the `-phpVERSION` suffix, where version is either `4`, `52`, `53`,
or `54`. For example, `redis-php52`, `redis-php53` and `redis-php54` would all be valid
formulae for their respective PHP versions.

All new extensions should have a `head` install url where possible.

Frameworks, Tools and Web Applications should go in `Formula`. Please not that not all items
are acceptable, especially Frameworks, so do not be offended if your formula is not pulled in.

## Todo

* Proper PHP Versioning? See issue [#1](https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php/issues/8)
* Pull out all PHP-related brews from Homebrew
